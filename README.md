- ğŸ‘‹ Yo, Iâ€™m @hiiny-serg
- ğŸ‘€ I'm currently interested in Java, Lua and C# (I like python, js, html and css too)
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning the basics of programmation.
- ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/she
- âš¡ Fun fact: I don't have many conditions to study programming,
- both financial and institutional because I live in the middle of nowhere, so there are no institutions here that offer any programming courses,
  so basically my study is online and through udemy courses
